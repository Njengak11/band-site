    <h1>ABOUT DA BAND</h1>
    <div class="about">
      <p>In 1984, Hollywood Rose member Izzy Stradlin was living with L.A. Guns member Tracii Guns.[1][2] When L.A. Guns needed a new vocalist, Stradlin suggested Hollywood Rose singer Axl Rose.[1] Guns N' Roses was formed in March 1985 by Rose and rhythm guitarist Stradlin, along with lead guitarist Tracii Guns, bassist Ole Beich, and drummer Rob Gardner of L.A. Guns.[3] The band coined its name by combining the names of both previous groups. Rejected names for the band included "Heads of Amazon" and "AIDS".[4] Their first show, promoted as "L.A. Guns and Hollywood Rose presents Guns N Roses", was on March 26, 1985.[5] After this show, Beich was fired and replaced by Duff McKagan.[6] Around this time, the band planned to release an EP with "Don't Cry", a cover of "Heartbreak Hotel", "Think About You" and "Anything Goes, and the band demoed the songs during their first radio interview.[7] However, plans for the release fell through, as Guns left the band after an argument with Rose leading to his replacement by Rose and Stradlin's one-time Hollywood Rose bandmate, Slash.[1] Gardner quit soon after and was replaced by another former Hollywood Rose member, Steven Adler.[8][9] Slash had also previously played with McKagan and Adler in Road Crew.
